#### Experience
Current and previous research has included analytical coding via **R** as the basis for:  
- Multi-level regression modeling  
- Propensity score matching (via *matchit* and a bespoke proxy for *psmatch2* in STATA)  
- Synthetic control analysis  (*synth* package)  
- Survival analysis (via *survival* and *servminer*)
- Meta-analysis (*meta* and *metafor* packages)  
- Power analysis (via *pwr* and *epiR*)  

Projects have also utilised basic comparative statistics (e.g., t-tests, chi-square, AUC, etc).  
I'm also comfortable in tidyverse, ggplot2, etc.
