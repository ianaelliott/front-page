Current and previous research has included analytical coding via **R** as the basis for:  
- **Multi-level regression modeling**  
- **Propensity score matching** (via *matchit* and a bespoke proxy for *psmatch2* in STATA)  
- **Synthetic control analysis**  (*synth* package)  
- **Survival analysis** (via *survival* and *servminer*)
- **Psychometric analyses** (via *CTT*, *ltm* and *lavaan*)  
- **Meta-analysis** (*meta* and *metafor* packages)  
- **Power analysis** (via *pwr* and *epiR*)  

Projects have also utilised basic comparative statistics (e.g., t-tests, chi-square, AUC, etc.)  
I'm also comfortable in tidyverse, ggplot2, etc.
